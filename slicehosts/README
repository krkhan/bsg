                                Pcap Host Slicer

This program can be used to extract multiple pcap files out of a single pcap
dump based on a list of hosts.

                                     Usage

  slicehosts pcapfile iplist

"pcapfile" is the trace that needs to be splitted. "iplist" contains a list of
IP addresses, one per each line, that need to be extracted from the trace.

Only IPv4 addresses are supported and consequently only IPv4 packets are
extracted. The extracted traces are generated in the current directory in the
form of "a.b.c.d.pcap" files, where a.b.c.d are quad-dotted IP addresses.
